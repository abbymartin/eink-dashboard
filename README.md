# E-ink Weather Dashboard

Weather forecast display for modded Kindle e-ink tablet. Experimenting with developing for my [jailbroken kindle](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/). Python Flask server creates dashboard image based on weather API (by modifying svg template and converting using ImageMagick). Kindle fetches new image every hour and updates display.
